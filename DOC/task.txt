[GAIA TASK]

	PLATFORM
	
		Optimize import library count. The crt-console app will only have 6 imported library(dll) in windows,
		But now, there are 20+ library(dll) be imported.

	FWORK STRUCTURE

		Instance remember the factory.
		
		Factory remember the Instance.
		

	ALGORITHM

		String based mathematics expression analyze. 1 * 2.4 / 5 = ?

		KMP substring search algorithm support.


	CONTAINER

		All container's iterator implement.

		All container's += = == != >= <= > < operator implement.

		All container's iterator = == != >= <= > < operator implement.

		Device-independent link-style container.

		Device-independent random-access container.

		Space path query based splash-ink algorithm implement.

		Dictionary container implement.

		Paragraph container implement.

		Document container implement.
		
		Accesser container support dynamic RAM capacity's increasement.

	MATH

		Coordinate class supported for super large scene.

		Intersection math arithmetic supported.

		
	Serializer

		Class DataRecord : Every object can convert to a DataRecord with as little data-copy as possible.
		The object can reconstruct from the DataRecord object too.

		Serializer storage DataRecord to target storage media and 
		restore object from DataRecord in target storage media.

		Storage and storage engine.

	Database



	Network

		TCP/UDP interface supported.

	Render

		ImageWork add ImageLayer component. ImageLayer support child-parent link.
		There are some ImageLayers in different types.
			BitmapLayer.
			ParametricLayer
		ImageLayer support mix method. There are some types follow.
			AlphaBlend.
			AlphaBlendEnhance.
			Add/Sub/Mul/Div.
			Mask.
		ImageLayer support global alpha.
		ImageLayer support ImageFilter. There are some filter follow.
			BlueFilter.
			GrayFilter.
			InnerShadowFilter.
			OutterShadowFilter.
			AntiAliasFilter.
		ImageLayer write operations will change the modify-mask, and the modify-mask can
		Understand which pixel has been changed.

	Sounder



	Physics



	UI System
	
	
	
	DATAPHASE
		
		XML support compress binary mode.
		
		XML support namefamily match node and property.
		
		XML support sort.
		
		XML support operator =, compare operator.
		
	TIME
		
		Timer implement.
		
		RealTimer implement.
		
		
	PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZE

		All object's size print to xml.

	PLATFORM TEST
	
		Base type size.


[PROMETHEUS TASK]

	Support '-h' for header path.
	Support '-predefine' for pre-processor defination.

	PL_FileRelationAnalyze : 
		Analyze the file include structure and generate PLC_FileRelation.(All able include)
		Every will have multi parents and multi childs.
		If the file is not exist which been included, will been signed with 'not exist'.

	PL_ObjAnalyzeBase : 
		Generate the PLC_ObjCtn only.(Nothting else at all)

	PL_ObjAnalyzeUnwrapMacro : 
		Analyze the final macros from root file to child file, and generate the macro object. 
		When analyze child file, will use the parents's macro defination, so parents's macro must have been analyzed complete.
